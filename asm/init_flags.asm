push r0, r2, r3, r4 ; preserve original register values

; Set r0 to the offset where flags start. In the vanilla rom, this is 0x21b553c.
; This is likely heap-allocated though, so the offset may change as we make modifications to the rom.
; So, we can't just use a constant. Luckily the link register contains the offset we need at this point,
; though it is offset by 0x30 so we must subtract that first.
